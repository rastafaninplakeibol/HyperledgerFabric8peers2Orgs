# HyperledgerFabric8peers2Orgs
This is an example of how to setup a HyperledgerFabric network with 4 peers per each Org on the same machine.
I spent days in order to configure everything and run it, hope to help!. 
See it as a draft to change based on how many peer you need in your network. Good luck!
